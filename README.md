Order Management API Documentation
This document describes the REST API endpoints provided by the OrderController class in the com.fawry_fridges.order.controller package. The API manages orders for the Fawry Fridges application, allowing users to create, retrieve, and search orders. The application integrates with RabbitMQ for asynchronous message processing, particularly for order creation and checkout operations.

Overview
The OrderController is a Spring Boot REST controller that handles HTTP requests related to order management. It uses the OrderService to process business logic and interacts with RabbitMQ to publish messages for asynchronous tasks, such as order creation and checkout. The controller supports pagination, sorting, and filtering for order searches.
RabbitMQ Integration
The application uses RabbitMQ as a message broker to handle asynchronous operations:

Order Creation: When a new order is created via the POST /api/orders endpoint, a message is published to a RabbitMQ queue (e.g., order-creation-queue) to process the order asynchronously.
Checkout: The POST /api/orders/checkout endpoint publishes a message to a RabbitMQ queue (e.g., order-checkout-queue) to handle payment processing, inventory updates, and order confirmation in the background.
Queue Configuration: Ensure RabbitMQ is running and configured with the appropriate queues and exchanges. The application uses Spring AMQP to integrate with RabbitMQ.

Example RabbitMQ configuration in application.yml:
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
    username: guest
    password: guest
